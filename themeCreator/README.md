## Import, save and export theme
Right from the start, you can import a theme from a JSON file. This can be useful if you want to import a theme you previously made or if you want to change something about a default one (you can always export all the themes from PDFPointer's settings!).

After you edited all the parameters, you'll be able to save the theme direclty into PDFPointer, and to apply the new theme now. You can also export it as a JSON file if you want to continue editing it later.
## Parameters to edit:
- Text color
- Dropdown text color
- The background of each settings category
- The background of the settings' dialog.
- The background of the app
- The color of the "cards"
- The color of each item in the tools and in the settings

You'll find a more detailed explaination with an example from that link.
